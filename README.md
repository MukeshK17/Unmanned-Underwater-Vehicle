üìñ Project Overview
This project focused on building a prototype of an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV). The prototype was designed using a PVC body, acrylic flanges, and rubber/PTFE gaskets to ensure watertight sealing. A ballast system was incorporated for vertical motion control, allowing adjustment of buoyancy during operation.
The key objective was to develop a low-cost, testable underwater platform while addressing critical design challenges such as sealing, structural integrity, and operational safety.

‚öôÔ∏è Features & Components
- Hull: PVC pipe structure
- Flanges: Acrylic, laser-cut, modified with 12 bolt holes (instead of 8) for improved sealing
- Gasket: PTFE gasket chosen for elasticity, water resistance, and reusability
- Ballast System: Provides up to 0.5 kg intake for buoyancy control
- Propulsion: Propeller shaft with bearing support

üîß Repairs & Improvements
- Propeller Shaft Bearing: Needs replacement due to wear and water leakage.
- Front-End Flange: Damaged acrylic flange requires replacement with a new one of the same dimensions.
